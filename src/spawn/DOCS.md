# src/spawn/

## Role

Worker spawning and orchestration — tmux sessions, git worktrees, Ghostty viewers, proxy injection. Touch this package when changing how workers are spawned, how worktrees are set up, or how the proxy is injected into worker environments.

## Public Interface

Sourced by `~/.local/bin/worker-cli` (all subcommands):
- `tmux_spawn.sh` — bash library for worker lifecycle ops

Invoked via `python3 -m src.spawn.spawn` by `worker-cli spawn`:
- `spawn.py` — worktree setup + tmux session launch (stdlib only)

## Modules

### tmux_spawn.sh (848 LOC)

**Purpose:** Bash library — worker lifecycle: spawn, list, status, capture, send. Handles proxy injection for Monitor_CC sessions automatically when `/tmp/.monitor_cc_proxy_*` marker exists. **Worker model resolution (2026-08, model-selector milestone 3):** `_resolve_worker_model()` — returns the `"worker"` key from `~/.claude/shared-rules/model_selection.json` (env-overridable via `MODEL_SELECTION_FILE`, for tests) if present and non-empty, else the hardcoded fallback `claude-sonnet-5`; uses `jq` with the same `2>/dev/null || true` fail-open idiom already established at the `hooks.json` read in `_worker_detect_status` (this file runs under `set -euo pipefail`). Used as the default in `spawn_claude_worker`'s and `spawn_claude_worker_from_file`'s `${4:-$(_resolve_worker_model)}` (bash short-circuits — never called when an explicit 4th arg is given), and in `worker_revive`'s fallback (`[ -z "$model" ] && model="$(_resolve_worker_model)"`) — revive's own stored `WORKER_MODEL` (the model the worker was ORIGINALLY spawned with) always wins over this; the config only applies when that stored value is itself absent. **For `worker-cli spawn`, `spawn.py`'s own resolution runs first** (see `spawn.py`'s entry below) and hands this file an already-concrete model string, so `_resolve_worker_model()` here isn't reached on that path EITHER WAY — by design, not a gap: `spawn.py` resolving once in Python and passing the result down is the intended shape. This function is load-bearing for direct callers of `spawn_claude_worker`/`spawn_claude_worker_from_file` that omit the model argument, and for `worker_revive`. **2026-08 fix (model-selector milestone 3):** a 5th hardcode site, `bin/worker-cli`'s own `spawn)` case, used to pre-resolve the "no model" case to a hardcoded literal BEFORE `spawn.py` ever ran — silently shadowing `spawn.py`'s resolution for every real `worker-cli spawn` call and making this milestone's fix dead code end-to-end. Fixed same milestone (`MODEL="${4:-}"` — passes an empty string through instead of pre-resolving); see `process-docs/model_selector/` (monitor-cc repo) for the full trace, including why the milestone's own file list didn't catch this.
**Reads:** tmux session list, proxy marker `/tmp/.monitor_cc_proxy_<session_id>`, project path, `~/Library/Application Support/com.brunowinter.monitor-cc-menubar/hooks.json` (working/idle source), `~/.claude/shared-rules/model_selection.json` (worker model fallback).
**Writes:** tmux sessions, Ghostty windows, worker mitmproxy processes, `/tmp/worker-<name>.done` signal file.
**Called by:** `~/.local/bin/worker-cli` (all subcommands via `source`); `spawn.py` (via subprocess for `spawn_claude_worker_from_file`).
**Calls out:** tmux, osascript/Ghostty, mitmdump, `~/.local/bin/claude-223`, `jq`.

`worker_capture_clean NAME [PROJECT_PATH]` — captures pane, scopes to output since last real orchestrator `❯` prompt, applies clean filter (see `_capture_clean.py`), prints to stdout. Called by `worker-cli capture` (default). `worker_capture` (raw pane to file) called via `worker-cli capture --raw`.

**Worker permission mode (2026-09-02):** workers launch with `--permission-mode acceptEdits`, not `--dangerously-skip-permissions` — the default `extra_flags` value in `spawn_claude_worker`/`spawn_claude_worker_from_file` (callers may still override via the 6th arg) and the hardcoded flag in `worker_revive`'s runner script. Changed because Claude Code 2.1.258 introduced permission mode `auto`, which fires a Sonnet harm-classifier side request with the full transcript on every tool call when `--dangerously-skip-permissions` combined with a global `defaultMode: auto` setting — workers were paying that classifier cost on every tool call.

**Status detection (`_worker_detect_status`):** closed three-value vocabulary (2026-09-02) — `working`, `idle`, `dead`; `unknown` is retired (no consumer needs a "no data" placeholder anymore) and the old `limit reached` label is retired too (it conflated a real process death with a user ESC-interrupt, which now reads as `idle`). `dead` = cannot accept a message: `#{pane_dead}=1`, no `claude` descendant under the pane pid, or the session JSONL's last assistant-type entry is Claude Code's client-side context-limit marker (`message.model=="<synthetic>"` + text `Prompt is too long` + `isApiErrorMessage=true` + `error="invalid_request"` — every later input fails the same way until `/compact`/`/clear`; anthropics/claude-code #90113, #23377). The marker check reads only the last 200 lines (`tail`, not a full slurp) — the marker is always the newest assistant entry, and a multi-megabyte session JSONL must stay cheap under `wait`'s 5s poll cadence. `idle` = `hooks.json[session_id].status=="idle"` (Stop hook fired), OR status `working`/absent with `#{window_activity}` stale > 10s (mirrors menubar `discover.py:178-181`) — this single window_activity check now covers BOTH the ESC-interrupt case (process alive, Stop hook never fired, pane quiet) and every former "no data" case (fresh spawn pre-JSONL, no hook entry, unreadable hooks file) once the pane itself has gone quiet. `working` is the default: fresh activity, or no dead/idle signal fired. Fail-open throughout: any unreadable check falls through toward `working`, never toward a dead-end. All paths return exit 0. See `process-docs/worker_status/worker_force_stop_detection.md`.

**spawn_claude_worker — Prompt-Inject Flow:**
claude starts bare (no positional prompt arg — prompt never touches the cmdline).
After session creation, a readiness gate polls `tmux capture-pane` for `^❯`
(U+276F at col 0 = CC input-ready). 30s deadline; timeout → `return 1`.
Prompt is injected via `load-buffer / paste-buffer / send-keys Enter` (same
as `worker_send`). Fragility: `^❯` marker is CC-version-dependent — if the
glyph changes, gate times out and spawn fails explicitly; update the grep
pattern. See `process-docs/worker_spawn/worker_spawn_prompt_injection.md`.

### _capture_clean.py (171 LOC)

**Purpose:** Scope + clean worker pane output. Takes `<pane_file> <worker_name>`, prints `=== capture from <name> (since last prompt, N chars) ===` + cleaned body to stdout.
**Reads:** raw tmux pane file (arg); searches backward for last `❯ <non-whitespace>` prompt anchor.
**Writes:** stdout only.
**Called by:** `worker_capture_clean()` in `tmux_spawn.sh` (via `python3 _capture_clean.py`).
**Calls out:** nothing (stdlib only).

Scope: slices to lines after the last real orchestrator prompt (`_RE_REAL_PROMPT = r'^❯\s+\S'`); pre-trims bottom widget (rule/bare-❯/Sonnet footer/bypass) so the bare input box never wins the anchor. Fallback: full buffer + `⚠` warning when no prompt in scrollback.

Clean filter — **Strip:** boot welcome box (`╭…╰`), thinking spinners (`✻`), `ctrl+o to expand` collapse markers, CC diff body lines (indented `<linenum>[+/-]content` after `Update()`/`Create()` headers — counter `⎿ Added N` kept, body dropped), bottom widget chrome (rule/bare-❯/Sonnet/bypass). **Keep:** `Update()`/`Create()` headers, `Added N, removed M` counters, `Read()`/`Bash()` headers, prose, Bash output, checklists. Leading `⏺`/`⎿` glyphs stripped from lines where they are the first character.

### spawn.py (138 LOC)

**Purpose:** Worktree setup + worker session launch. Stdlib only — no fastmcp, no external deps. **Worker model resolution (2026-08, model-selector milestone 3):** the `model` CLI positional's argparse default changed from the hardcoded literal `"claude-sonnet-5"` to `None`, so `args.model` can be told apart from "not given" instead of colliding with a real value; `resolved_model = args.model or _resolve_worker_model()` — `_resolve_worker_model()` reads the `"worker"` key from `~/.claude/shared-rules/model_selection.json` (`MODEL_SELECTION_FILE`, env-overridable for tests), falling back to the hardcoded `"claude-sonnet-5"` on any error or a missing/empty key; never raises. `resolved_model` (always a concrete non-empty string, never the literal string `"None"`) is what actually reaches `spawn_workflow`/`tmux_spawn`. **Load-bearing for `worker-cli spawn` since the same milestone's follow-up fix:** `bin/worker-cli`'s own `spawn)` case used to pre-resolve its 4th positional to a hardcoded literal (`MODEL="${4:-claude-sonnet-5}"`) BEFORE ever invoking this module — `args.model` was never actually `None` on that path, so this module's own resolution never ran for a real `worker-cli spawn` call, making the whole worker-model-config feature dead code end-to-end despite every individual piece working correctly in isolation. Fixed in `bin/worker-cli` (`MODEL="${4:-}"` — passes an empty string through when no model arg is given, which argparse stores as `''`, which `args.model or _resolve_worker_model()` correctly treats as falsy). Verified end-to-end with a real subprocess call to `bin/worker-cli spawn` (not a sourced-function unit check) — see `process-docs/model_selector/` (monitor-cc repo) for the full trace and why the milestone's own file list missed this site.
**Reads:** prompt file, project dir (`.claude/settings.local.json`, `venv/`), `~/.claude/shared-rules/model_selection.json` (worker model fallback, only when no CLI model argument is given).
**Writes:** git worktree at `.claude/worktrees/<name>`, copies `settings.local.json`, symlinks `venv/`, then calls `spawn_claude_worker_from_file` via bash subprocess.
**Called by:** `~/.local/bin/worker-cli spawn` (via `cd "$PLUGIN" && python3 -m src.spawn.spawn`).
**Calls out:** git (via subprocess), bash + tmux_spawn.sh (via subprocess).

## Usage

```bash
# Via worker-cli (standard)
worker-cli spawn <name> <prompt_file> <project_path> [model] [--no-worktree]

# Direct (from plugin root)
python3 -m src.spawn.spawn <name> <prompt_file> <project_path> [model] [--no-worktree]
```

### Cross-project Lifecycle

When a worker needs to operate in a DIFFERENT repo from the one it was spawned into:

```bash
# 1. Spawn worker in the spawn project (creates spawn-side worktree + registry entry)
worker-cli spawn <name> <prompt_file> <spawn-project> [model]

# 2. Create + register a worktree in the target project (default branch = <name>)
worker-cli worktree <name> <target-repo> [branch]
# → creates <target-repo>/.claude/worktrees/<name> on branch <name>
# → appends "<target-repo>\t<branch>" to $REGISTRY_DIR/<name>.worktrees (sidecar)
# → echoes the absolute worktree path for use in the worker prompt

# 3. Worker does its work in the target worktree (path echoed above)

# 4. Kill cleans BOTH sides (spawn-side + all entries in the sidecar)
worker-cli kill <name>
```

**Sidecar format:** `$REGISTRY_DIR/<name>.worktrees` — one `<target-repo>\t<branch>` per line (tab-separated). Multiple cross-project worktrees for the same worker are each on their own line. `kill` reads and deletes this file automatically; `list`/`status --all` skip `*.worktrees` files so they are never treated as worker names.

**Orphan cleanup** (worktrees that predate registration — no sidecar exists):
```bash
worker-cli worktree-rm <target-repo> <name> [branch]
# → removes <target-repo>/.claude/worktrees/<name> + deletes branch (best-effort)
# → no registry/sidecar involvement
```

## Gotchas

- `spawn.py` derives `PLUGIN_DIR` from `__file__` — call `python3 -m` from any cwd, `TMUX_SPAWN_SH` resolves correctly.
- `worker-cli spawn` converts relative paths to absolute before `cd "$PLUGIN"` to avoid path drift.
- Proxy injection: `spawn_claude_worker` reads `/tmp/.monitor_cc_proxy_<md5(project_path)>`. If marker absent → worker spawns without proxy (silent, no error).
