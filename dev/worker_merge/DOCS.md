# dev/worker_merge/

## Role

Test for `worker-cli merge` (`src/worker_cli/cmd_lifecycle.sh`) — the merge command's
built-in outcome verification, which replaced the orchestrator's by-hand post-merge check.

## Modules

### test_merge_verify.sh (133 LOC)

**Purpose:** Exercise the real `worker-cli merge` binary against a throwaway git repo
(explicit `project_path` argument, no registry entry, no tmux). Covers a real merge
(branch with a commit) printing `=== Files merged ===` with the correct file list and
landing the merge commit; a repeat merge on the same fully-merged branch hitting the
"Already up to date" no-op path — asserts the stderr line names the no-op and both known
causes (missing `project_path` on a cross-project worker; a worker that never committed),
plus the non-zero exit code; and a genuine conflict (same file, diverging edits on both
sides) — asserts git's own `CONFLICT` text still reaches stdout and the exit code is
non-zero, guarding the `set +e` / explicit-`$?` capture around the merge call that keeps
a conflict's output from being swallowed by this script's own `set -e`.
**Usage:** `bash dev/worker_merge/test_merge_verify.sh`
